### Today's Text:

> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. (Psalm 23:1)



### Today's Prayer:

**The Lord is my Shepherd…**

Lord, you are the great shepherd who cares for me. Thank you for being more than a “distant ‘king’ or ‘deliver’, or an impersonal ‘rock’, ’shield’ ”[^1]. You live with your flock and are my guide, physician, and protector. 
[^1]: Quoted from Derek Kidner's Commentary in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries Series. 

Lord, Would you shepherd me today? 

- As I work through my **finances**, would you guide me to spend money on what’s important?
- As I shepherd my **children**, help me remember your loving example so that I don’t react to situations in anger.
- As I consider **weighty decisions**, would you guide me to the wise answer?

Would you guide me at work and help me serve my coworkers with love and patience? Would you shepherd my family? Would you shepherd my nation?

Thank you for your faithfulness in walking with me through all the seasons of my life, 

In Jesus, The Good Shepherd's Name, amen.
